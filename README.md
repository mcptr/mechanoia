# mechanoia

Mechanoia is an experimental project on scraping, indexing and searching the web.

Basic ideas:
- ignore top million domains
- documents and information first
- rank websites' noise level by analysing the amount of javascript, trackers, etc.
- rank domains
- analyse domains, certificates, metadata
